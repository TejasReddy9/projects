## Live Twitter-data Sentiment Analysis
#### NLTK, Text-data analysis

Live tweets from twitter are classified w.r.t their sentiment calculated by hand-made classifier using various insights from pre-existential models. A live graph corresponding to the live twitter streaming data is presented.

## Smallest enclosing circle
#### Bichromatic Data Structures, Algorithms

Beyond NP problems like Conflict-free Covering(from research papaer) are studied and implemented over Bichromatic data, where data has to be seperated by a smallest circle enclosing one type of data-points.

## Walmart Store Sales Forecasting
#### Linear Regression, Data Visualisation and Prediction

A gradient boosting regression model which predicts the department-wide sales for each store. Complete data is hosted by Walmart, it is perfectly pruned according to the prediction before doing the actual prediction using statistical visualisation results from R.
